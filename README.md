# Introduction

Hello! My name is Timothy Gribbin and I'm a computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial intelligence. I'm interested in all things CS but particularly have an interest in machine learning, full-stack applications, and problem solving. Transferred from Suffolk County Community College, graduated with a Associates of Science in Computer Science with a 4.0 GPA. I was also a CS tutor and President of the CS club there as well.

# Languages and Technologies

I would say Java is the programming language that I have used the most and I'm most comfortable with. I'm also proficient in Python, C, and Typescript/Javascript.

I'm comfortable working with frameworks & libraries such as Node.js, React.js, Next.js, Vite, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

Some technologies and tools I'm comfortable using are Git, MySQL, Docker, Postman, Jupyter Notebook, Eclipse, MongoDB, Firebase, and Supabase

# Featured Projects

The project I'm most proud of is PITSTOP, a one-stop-shop for planning a trip collaboratively. This is a solo venture and I'm the only contributor. My application eliminates the need for messy groupchats and awkward conversations about splitting expenses or what music to listen to. All of the stops along the way and music you listen to is voted on by all members of the trip, expenses are also tracked in app. This application will be deployed soon and you will be easily able to view and use it. Stay tuned!

Another project I have worked on are an Signature Forgery Detection ML model. This was presented at the SUNY Undergraduate Research Conference in Binghamton, NY in April 2025. This model was built using a convolutional neural netwrok (CNN) from TensorFlow. The data was organized using Numpy. This model achieved a 91% validation accuracy for detecting a forged signature. This research project was completed under the advisement of Professor Bin Li. 

Lastly, I am very proud of winning the HopperHacks Hackathon with our project cleverly named HopperHelps. HopperHelps is a journaling application that keeps track of your mood over extended periods. This application uses AI sentiment analysis to figure out what you are feeling based off of your journal entries and color codes your calender on that specific day. Eventually, you will see a pattern of your moods on certain days, maybe you have a bad day every day on Thursday and you can address the stressors that may be contributing to that. In a world where mental health often gets put on the back burner in exchange for grades or career advancement, HopperHelps gives you an easy way to take a few minutes and keep track of your mood and feelings over long periods of times. This project was built with 3 classmates in the span of 24 hours.
